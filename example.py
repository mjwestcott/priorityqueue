An Example Use of priorityqueue.py: Solving the 'Skyline' Problem

For a description of the problem: https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/1/p105.pdf

Our strategy is as follows. We want to scan the horizon left to right. If at
any point the maximum height of a building at the current x coordinate changes,
we should make a note of that (x, height) pair.

In order to achieve this, we can first make a list of all x coordinates where a
building start or ends. These are the significant x values. In fact, we want to
map these x values to the list of buildings that start or end there.

Then we can loop through these x values. For each one:
    - If we are at an x coordinate where a building starts we will append its
      height to a list.
    - If we are at an x coordinate where a buildings ends we will remove its
      height from the list.
    - Look up the max from the heights list, and if it is different
      from the last height we found, then make note of a new (x, height) pair.

The data structure holding the heights was described as a list. But note that
we are performing max(), append(), and remove() operations on it. A Python list
will take O(n), O(1) and O(n) time respectively. We can do better using a
heap-based data structure which operates in O(1), O(logn), and O(logn) time
respectively.

Since we are looping over two x values for each building and performing O(logn)
operations each time, the algorithm described above will run in O(nlogn) where
n is the number of buildings. The naive implementation using a list will run in
O(n**2).
